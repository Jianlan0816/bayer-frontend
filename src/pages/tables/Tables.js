          <p>The CKD Population Navigator is a data visualization and analytics tool based upon the results of a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of the Optum Administrative claims database to describe the Chronic Kidney Disease and Type 2 Diabetes patient landscape within the database in the year 2019.</p>
            
          <p>The tool allows users to explore the following characteristics in the type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and CKD and T2D populations: demographic, clinical (i.e., events, comorbidities), medication use, and kidney labs.</p>
